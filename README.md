## General idea behind the Pic2Story
`Pic2Story` is the idea of an NLP tool which, given a set of images, provides the user with generated text - a type of story inspired by the inputted pictures.

The emphasis is put on the latter part of the project; therefore, the image object recognition aspect is not to be considered the core of the application (`YOLO` has been utilized).

### The main points of interest are:
- creating an English story-based corpus,
- developing a tool for automatic text generation,
- utilizing the text-generation tool based on the corpus, alongside the annotated images with the detected object.

### To be considered in further stages:
- custom object detection,
- deployment of the app as a web application to allow accessability for the online users.
